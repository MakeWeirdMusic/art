## SVG artwork for MWM website

All portrait artwork for MWM is in 1000x1000 pixel SVG format with transparent background. For each SVG image, there should be a corresponding 1000x1000 PNG raster file with an opaque white background. (This is primarily done for social media sharing.)

If there is a video associated with content, the video thumbnail images go in a folder called `interview` within the artist's folder. The artist's folder name should be all lowercase with hyphens instead of spaces (e.g. `steve-vai`, `the-residents`, `henry-cow`). The SVG should be 1920x1080 or 1280x720 and there should be rastered PNGs with the following file naming convention `artist-name-interview-thumbnail-1280x720.png`. The SVG file should not have a file size conveyed in the title (e.g. `artist-name-interview-thumbnail.svg`).

Please contact me if you're interested in doing artwork or improving existing artwork. Thanks!
